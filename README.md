How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Mongoose, Express

Optimizations
Would like to create more options to search for your recipes. Including different sorting functions.

Eventually make this app into a social media app where users can share recipes to one another. Also add an explore other peoples recipes.

Lessons Learned:
Learned a deeper understanding of MVC, mongoose, EJS, Passport, node and express. Learned the limitations of EJS.
